Given the provided specifications and understanding that some of the business requirements from the BRD are not explicitly provided, I will create a baseline service architecture utilizing Python Flask for microservices, Docker for containerization, Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for the database, and Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I'll create necessary configurations, a Dockerfile, unit tests, and documentation to ensure a fully functional project.
